Database meant for storing users and contents's meta-data. It has been developed for the 2020 Database course at the [*Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Parthenope*](https://github.com/uniparthenope).

## The idea

The project it's the product of a personal idea proposed to my Database teacher. It has been conceived to best suit the needs of any video-streaming platform such as Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+.

The main packages in the project are: contents' meta-data, reviews, playlists, payment related tables, and users' data.

Below it's shown a relational diagram, which makes the tables' relationships clear. As it can be noted, the third normal form has been satisfied.
